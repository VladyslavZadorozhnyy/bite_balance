This project implements an Android application for calorie counting, adhering to the principles of MVVM architecture, imperative UI development, Clean Architecture, SQLite for data storage, and reactive programming.

Features
- Track calorie intake throughout the day.
- No internet connection required - data is stored locally on the device.
- Clean separation of concerns with MVVM and Clean Architecture.
- Leverage SQLite for efficient data persistence.
- Implement reactive programming for asynchronous operations.
- Custom views implemented
- Microservice approach

Technologies Used
- MVVM Architecture: Separates the application logic into Model-View-ViewModel layers for better maintainability and testability.
- Imperative UI Development: Utilizes traditional Android UI development techniques using Activities, Fragments, and View components.
- Clean Architecture: Promotes separation of concerns by isolating business logic from UI concerns and external frameworks.
- SQLite: Provides a lightweight and efficient way to store application data locally on the device.
- Reactive Programming: Enables asynchronous and non-blocking operations for improved responsiveness and handling of data flow.
